title: A Public Commitment
---

I have "taken" many online courses and have, unfortunately, only finished a few
of them. I would like to change that. My goal is to take courses and then
present to you short summaries of each lecture here. Each post will consist of
less than 1000 words and will have plenty of diagrams which I made in the
process of learning the concepts. 

Other than making a commitment public, which will hopefully allow me to continue
the course, my secondary goal is to have a nice, neat, index of all the courses
I have taken and have detailed proof - if you will - that I actually took those
courses. Now, I can't guarantee that the courses I take will be related to
computer science or pure maths etc but I can guarantee that I will be taking
courses. 

If the course is a computer science related course then I will also be posting
some source code through [github](http://github.com/jeel-shah) of the programs I
make. Furthermore, I will try to devise or find an end of course project to
apply the principles I learned throughout the course. 

##### What I am Taking Currently and I Intend to Take 

Currently I am taking [MIT
6.006](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011)
Introduction to Algorithms. I have done two lectures, for which I will be
posting the synopsi soon. There are a number of courses that I want to take
after this, some of them being: 


1. [Automata](https://www.coursera.org/course/automata)
2. [Introduction to Computer
   Networking](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Networking-SP/SelfPaced/about)
3. [Introduction to Cloud
   Computing](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-cloud-computing-ieeex-cloudintro-x-0)
4. [Compilers](https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers)
5. [Databases](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about)

The reason why I have chosen these is because I know _very little_ about all of
these things, especially the first couple. Some of the others I have chosen
because they sound cool, luckily I have the luxury of doing that.

##### Some Rules for Myself ###### Or, A Way Out if the Course Sucks

I intend to complete every course I enroll in, however if the course sucks in
the sense that I am not liking the content or the way it is taught then I have
up to five lectures to quit; should I pass the five lecture threshold then I
_must_ complete the course.

There it is. My commitment in writing for the world to see - should I fail then
I hope that the world will shame me into starting again. `:)`
